# Figure 1: bsaseq workflow and example output

## Figure description

**Figure 1. bsaseq analysis workflow and genome-wide Manhattan plot.**

(A) Schematic overview of the bsaseq analysis pipeline. Input VCF files containing variants from pooled mutant and wild-type bulks are processed through sliding window analysis with tricube smoothing. Z-scores are calculated genome-wide, and regions exceeding the significance threshold are identified as candidate QTL intervals. Optional snpEff annotation ranks candidate variants by predicted functional impact.

(B) Example genome-wide Manhattan plot from sorghum ms8 male-sterility mapping analysis. Each point represents a genomic window, with the y-axis showing the Z-score. The horizontal dashed line indicates the significance threshold (Z = 3.0). The candidate region on chromosome 2 shows a clear peak corresponding to the ms8 locus.

(C) Regional zoom plot of the candidate interval showing per-variant delta allele frequency (delta-AF). High delta-AF variants within the peak region represent candidate causal mutations.

## File naming convention

For the actual manuscript, replace this placeholder with:
- `figure1.png` or `figure1.pdf` - Composite figure
- `figure1a.png` - Workflow schematic (can be created in BioRender or similar)
- `figure1b.png` - Genome-wide Manhattan plot (generated by bsaseq)
- `figure1c.png` - Regional plot (generated by bsaseq)

## Generating example figures

```bash
# Run bsaseq on the ms8 dataset to generate plots

## Caption for JOSS paper

> **Figure 1.** Genome-wide Manhattan plot generated by bsaseq showing Z-scores across all chromosomes for a sorghum male-sterility mapping experiment. The y-axis shows the Z-score for each sliding window, with the horizontal dashed line indicating the significance threshold (Z = 3.0). A clear peak on chromosome 2 identifies the candidate region containing the ms8 locus. Points are colored by chromosome for visual distinction.

## Caption for BioRxiv paper (expanded)

> **Figure 1. bsaseq analysis pipeline and validation results.** (A) Overview of the bsaseq workflow: VCF input containing pooled sequencing data from phenotypically contrasting bulks undergoes quality filtering, allele frequency calculation, sliding window analysis with tricube smoothing, and statistical testing. Candidate regions are identified based on Z-score thresholds, and optional snpEff annotation provides functional predictions for variant prioritization. (B) Genome-wide Manhattan plot from analysis of sorghum ms8 male-sterility data (PRJNA1134249). Z-scores are plotted for 1 Mb sliding windows with 250 kb steps across all chromosomes. The horizontal dashed line indicates the significance threshold (Z = 3.0). A prominent peak on chromosome 2 (highlighted in red) corresponds to the known ms8 locus location. (C) Detailed view of the chromosome 2 candidate region showing delta allele frequency (delta-AF = AF_mutant - AF_wildtype) for individual variants. Candidate causal variants show delta-AF approaching 1.0, consistent with recessive inheritance in the mutant pool.
